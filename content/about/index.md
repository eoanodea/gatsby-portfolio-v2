I help people grow their businesses, and build cool stuff.

I've worked as a Freelance Web Developer for over 4 years, and during this time have completed over 25 successful projects, and pleased many clients.

I'm based mainly on the web, but I also dabble in other cool stuff, and am always open to learning new things.
